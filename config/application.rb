    # If a client submits invalid / poorly formatted JSON to a Rails app,
    # a cryptic and unhelpful error is thrown. The middleware that parses
    # parameters (ActionDispatch::ParamsParser) runs long before the
    # controller is on the scene, and throws exceptions when invalid JSON
    # is encountered. You canâ€™t capture the parsing exception in the
    # controller, as the controller is never involved in serving the
    # failed request.
